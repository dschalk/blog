<h3>A Simple Monad</h3>
<p> In order to be a Category Theory monad, a function must exist in a category. JavaScript objects (including functions) don't constitute a category. But functions that hold values and compose with multiple functions that operate on their values behave like Category Theory monads enough to justify calling them "monads".</p>
<p> Here's the definitions of three functions: </p>
<pre>{cow}</pre>
<p> And here's an anonymous monod followed by three functions and "stop". : </p>
<pre> Monad(6)(sum(7))(prod(4))(v=>v-10)(stop) // 42 </pre>
<p> It gave the expected result, 42. If you change the definition of the anonymous monad, the result will be displayed below.</p>
<input id = "one" on:keyup = {compute}  />

<span> Monad(</span>
<span>{num}</span>
<span>)(sum(7))(prod(4))(v=>v-10)(stop) returns </span>
<span> {res} </span>
<p> Named monads retain their values, even after they return the value of x. The following examples illustrate this: </p>
<pre>
{axe}
</pre>
<p> As expected, mon() is still the foo() returned by Monad(). Because mon() maintains a reference to the x in the context of its creation, x will not be garbage collected. </p>
<p> It is convenient to have state, in the form of x, safely tucked away in a closure, but if later in your program you no longer have any use for x, it's up to you to destroy it. </p>
<p> One reason Svelte is so fast and efficient is that it mutates variables and objects. It has risen above the conventional "wisdom" of the day. If you want to save value of x in mon, you can do this: </p>

<pre>{fred}</pre>
<span class = tao> Better yet, keep the array of computation results in the closure. It would then be convenient to run functions on array elements or the array itself. Monads could be asychronous, populating the array with Promise resolution values. They could even be made to perform multiple array transformation - icluding map, filter, and reduce - in a single step, just as transducers do. Here comes a Swiss army knife definition that does all of these things. I'll call it "Monad2". </span>
<span id = aside> I leave sentence punctuation outside of quotation marks, which is customary in the UK.</span>
