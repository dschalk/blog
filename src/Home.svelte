<p> This blog is a place for me to store ideas that I don't want to forget, and which I hope at least some people will find thought provoking, informative, or just interesting. I'll mostly write about computer programming, but already there is a post on bed bug eradication. I practiced law for twenty-three years, so there will probably be some posts related to that. My undergraduate degree is in chemistry and when I was the city of Bloomington, Indiana's "City Chemist", I was in the center of some intense drama involving public safety and governmental skulduggery.</p>

<p>This blog has characteristics of a journal and of my momoirs. But is mostly about computer programming, with special attention to web development, functional and reactive programming, and my experiences with IBM's public access quantum computer and other quantum computers that provide free online access.his blog is a place for me to store ideas that I don't want to forget, and which I hope at least some people will find thought provoking, informative, or just interesting.
